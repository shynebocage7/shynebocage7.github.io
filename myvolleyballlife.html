    		<h1>My Volleyball Life</h1>

			<P>Volleyball was a hobby that came naturally to me and it just stuck with me forever. I started on the middle school team when I was in fourth grade and I loved it from the start. I didn't know anything about volleyball so I tried out for the travel team to get more experience and get better skills. My sister and I both were on the 12 and under team together and made many volleyball friends and just enjoyed being young, playing volleyball. I had a really strict coach at the time and she would make us run if we dropped one ball, knowing that we were only 12 years old and it is the youngest team someone could be on.</P>

			<P>I went back and forth from being in the setters’ position to becoming a passer at the first two travel teams I played on. Playing on these travel teams made me MVP every year on my middle school teams and I was way more advanced than the other players which had me playing down to their level at times because I was too strong for some kids. Then I got to high school and freshman year, my coach knew little about volleyball so I was basically an assistant coach and he appreciated my help. I would intimidate some of the other players because I was strong and well experienced in volleyball. In high school I was always the setter, so I had the same responsibilities of a quarterback in football and switching from setter in high school to passer in travel ball was hard some times.</P>

			<P>I got a ganglion cyst on my right wrist about freshman year that would restrain my movement in my wrist and this did not help the fact that I needed to make my sets more consistent in order to become the top setter each year. Whenever my wrist would decide to give out, it would affect my performance and my coaches did not trust me to be consistent all of the time. Once I was on the varsity team, there were three people in the setters’ position and I was obviously the most experienced and consistent, but the coach thought he should play his daughter over me and I was always the second choice. Then my second year of varsity, the same thing happened, where an underclassman was pulled up that had more height than me yet didn't have the same skill as me, but I was still second choice. This would annoy me because it was either play me and win or put me on the bench and lose, so I just had to deal with it because my coach would not change his mind. So I would use travel ball as more of a redemption from high school because I was the only setter one year and was able to take over the position easily and we had a great year.</P>

			<P>As soon as it gets to my 18's year of travel, a junior setter is taken onto the team and she is taller than me with less skill, but once again my coach decides to play her over me. I would rant with my family all of the time and they would understand and agreed with me and thought rotations should be changed, but I was in no position to change that. It was the last game of one of my tournaments and we were fighting for playoffs and my coach decides to play the other setter and we do terribly in the first set. And halfway into the second set, he decides to change up the whole rotation and play me. This allowed us to get a significant amount of points, but we were so far behind that I couldn’t do anything to help us win and I already knew we would have had a better chance of winning if my coach had played me in the beginning of the match.</P>
