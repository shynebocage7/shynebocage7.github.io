			<P>Living in Hawaii and California were two different experiences and took some getting used to. In Hawaii, the dress code is way different because the weather was not the same and some items of clothing were more socially acceptable than in California. My school had a short day every Wednesday, so my family would all go to the beach after school and just play in the sand and have fun.</P>

			<P>I participated in gymnastics for 3 years as we lived in Hawaii and after every session, my parents or grandparents would bring me a spam musubi to snack on as we headed home. During the moving process, my parents were asking what we should throw away or not and as children, we knew no better. We did not know anything about how it would be like in California. At the beginning of getting used to moving, my little sister, Rein, wanted to know what kind of hobbies or sports we were going to try. My father insisted on trying volleyball and it ended up becoming a part of my entire life since then.</P>

			<P>When we first moved, my older sister already started to use more curse words than when we lived in Hawaii. That was the start of the whole family creating a whole vocabulary of curse words, which got worse over time. At our house in Hawaii, my sisters and I lived in one room and when we moved everyone got their own room. It gave us more space to be ourselves and spread our personality over the space we had. Me and my sisters were young at the time of the move and told our father to pop the water bed because we thought we wouldn't need it and years later regretted that decision. California is so hot in the summer and most of the other parts of the year and I was begging for any source of cold temperature. That just brings up the thought of why we thought getting rid of that water bed was a good idea. We didn't have a good air conditioning system at first, so we would be stuck in 100-degree heat and hotter without any air conditioning. Living in California's boiling heat made me want to move as soon as I could and college was the opportunity for me.</P>
