			<P>I began to cook when I was very young and was fascinated from the beginning. My uncle is a chef and whenever I would go to Hawaii and visit my motherâ€™s side of the family, my uncle would teach me how to cook. I learned how to safely cut vegetables with a very sharp knife, although I definitely cut myself along the way. Nothing happened that ever made me dislike cooking.</P>

			<P>As a child I loved to make all of my food super spicy and no matter what my spice levels would exceed those of all of my family members. I loved making all types of Asian dishes, I looked up a Pad Thai recipe and tried it out. The first time I made it, it turned out great and I enjoyed making it every once in a while. We were having a family get together at my house, and I was in charge of making the food so I prepared my Pad Thai dish and people were enjoying it even though I made it too spicy for some and it burned their mouths as they ate more.</P>

			<P>My love for cooking made me the house chef because my family did not want to cook for themselves and I was glad to try out new recipes or make something as simple as fried rice. While my sisters and I spent the summer in Hawaii, my grandmother made these fried noodles with vegetables and Portuguese sausage that we immediately fell in love with. Ever since then, it became the house favorite and every chance I could get some noodles and Portuguese sausage in the fridge, I would make some fried noodles. The only way it would be possible to complete this dish was to have some teriyaki sauce that we would have sent from my grandparents in Hawaii or from our trips back. Hawaiian teriyaki sauce was the key ingredient to making this dish so flavorful and easy to enjoy because other teriyaki sauces in California were way too salty. Another dish that was popular in my household was salmon with teriyaki sauce or simple garlic butter and my mother would always make me do it because she had to get home from work and was hungry. My father loves smoothies and he tells me how he misses my homemade smoothies because my mother doesn't make them as good and I just find it so funny. I always miss the pleasure of making my own dinner and being able to add my own twist to the dish even though it doesn't need it. </P>
