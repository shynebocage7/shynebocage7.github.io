    		<h1>My Background</h1>

			<P>I was born in Oahu, Hawaii and lived there for 6 years. My father got a job opportunity in California so we moved to Tracy, where I spent the rest of my life. When I was around 11 years old, I started to play volleyball in middle school and on a club team. My Sophomore year was when my father wanted me to think about possible career and I chose to become a pilot. I wanted to take a break off of playing volleyball and did Shot Put and Discus for the Track and Field team in the Spring.</P>

			<P>Taking this break allowed me to have some free time and go to my flying lessons at a municipal airport near my house. I was planning on becoming a pilot and going into the Air Force or to the Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. I was interested for a while, but I couldn't stick with new activities much when I was younger and I just stopped going. My eyesight got worse over time, so it was like my body was telling me that becoming a pilot wasn't for me.</P>

			<P>Then my Junior year, I thought of some hobbies that I have or things that come naturally to me and told my father that I wanted to become a chef. I started cooking when I was about 10 years old and have loved it ever since. My father thought that it would be better for me to go to college and get a degree in order for me to become a restaurant owner and also be a chef. I thought it was a great idea because it gives me a better chance at succeeding and getting paid more for what I do and love. Now, I am working to begin this goal of mine to be a chef and become my own boss one day.</P>
